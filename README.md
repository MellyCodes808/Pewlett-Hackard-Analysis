# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpopse of this analysis is to identify how many employees are retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This program was written to better prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age and there are not enough seasoned and knowledgeable employees to replace them.

In Devlierable 1 - I created a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. this includes employees with multiple titles in the database—for example due to promotions, so a table that contains the most recent title of each employee was created. I  also created a table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title. Lastly, because we want to include only current employees in our analysis, we excluded those employees who have already left the company.

In Deliverable 2-  I created a mentorship-eligibility table that shows the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program.

____________
Results:.

-The most relevant result from the table is the huge amount of Senior Engineers that are going to be possible retired employees.
-using the unique titles table we can see that we have 72,458 employees on the brink of retirement 
-Using the mentorship elgiblity we can see that we only have 1940 elgible mentors!

Summary:


In conclusion we can see that alot of employees are leaving the company soon and the company is not prepared.As the "silver tsunami" takes effect, 72,458 roles will need to be filled!Using the mentorship elgiblity we can see that we only have 1940 elgible mentors- There will be a lot of new employees and few possible mentors.The most important roles that need to be filled are going to be Senior Engineer and Senior Staff because those titles have a huge amount of employees compared to the others. The company needs to create a plan because the number of Senior Engineers that are going to leave the company is quite higher than the number of possible mentors required for the training of new employees for those free places.

Other queries could investigate :
What job tittle range are most mentors needed? 
We could change the age range for mentoring since the company is short on resources- perhaps changing the age range up to 1970.
